# Initial volume in decibel. 0.0 is 'full volume', -10 correspondents to '75' on

# If you explicitly choose a specific ALSA device here (find them with 'aplay -L'), then

# Otherwise, whatever default is configured for gstreamer for the '$DAEMON_USER' is
# used.

# For example, you can specify a logfile with this line
