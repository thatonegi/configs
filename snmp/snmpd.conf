# SECTION: Agent Operating Mode
#
#   This section defines how the agent will operate when it
#   is running.

# master: Should the agent operate as a master agent or not.
#   Currently, the only supported master agent type for this token
#   is "agentx".
#   
#   arguments: (on|yes|agentx|all|off|no)

master  yes

# agentuser: The system user that the agent runs as.
#   arguments: name|#uid

agentuser  snmp

# agentgroup: The system group that the agent runs as.
#   arguments: group|#GID

agentgroup  snmp

# agentaddress: The IP address and port number that the agent will listen on.
#   By default the agent listens to any and all traffic from any
#   interface on the default SNMP port (161).  This allows you to
#   specify which address, interface, transport type and port(s) that you
#   want the agent to listen on.  Multiple definitions of this token
#   are concatenated together (using ':'s).
#   arguments: [transport:]port[@interface/address],...

#agentaddress

# SECTION: Monitor Various Aspects of the Running Host
#
#   The following check up on various aspects of a host.

# disk: Check for disk space usage of a partition.
#   The agent can check the amount of available disk space, and make
#   sure it is above a set limit.  
#   
#    disk PATH [MIN=100000]
#   
#    PATH:  mount path to the disk in question.
#    MIN:   Disks with space below this value will have the Mib's errorFlag set.
#           Can be a raw integer value (units of kB) or a percentage followed by the %
#           symbol.  Default value = 100000.
#   
#   The results are reported in the dskTable section of the UCD-SNMP-MIB tree

disk  /dev/sda8 5%

# load: Check for unreasonable load average values.
#   Watch the load average levels on the machine.
#   
#    load [1MAX=12.0] [5MAX=12.0] [15MAX=12.0]
#   
#    1MAX:   If the 1 minute load average is above this limit at query
#            time, the errorFlag will be set.
#    5MAX:   Similar, but for 5 min average.
#    15MAX:  Similar, but for 15 min average.
#   
#   The results are reported in the laTable section of the UCD-SNMP-MIB tree

load  8 5 7

# SECTION: System Information Setup
#
#   This section defines some of the information reported in
#   the "system" mib group in the mibII tree.

# syslocation: The [typically physical] location of the system.
#   Note that setting this value here means that when trying to
#   perform an snmp SET operation to the sysLocation.0 variable will make
#   the agent return the "notWritable" error code.  IE, including
#   this token in the snmpd.conf file will disable write access to
#   the variable.
#   arguments:  location_string

syslocation  "Oregon City"

# syscontact: The contact information for the administrator
#   Note that setting this value here means that when trying to
#   perform an snmp SET operation to the sysContact.0 variable will make
#   the agent return the "notWritable" error code.  IE, including
#   this token in the snmpd.conf file will disable write access to
#   the variable.
#   arguments:  contact_string

syscontact  bljohnston@gmail.com

# sysservices: The proper value for the sysServices object.
#   arguments:  sysservices_number

sysservices 72
